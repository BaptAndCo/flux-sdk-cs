Welcome Flux developer! The Flux SDK connects your app to popular design tools like SketchUp, Revit, Excel, Google Sheets, Grasshopper, Dynamo, 3ds Max and AutoCAD. You can also exchange data with other 3rd party apps that use the Flux SDK. By connecting to Flux, your app will have direct access to projects and data created by Flux users. Users will be required to log in with their Flux credentials and authorize your app.

To get started, you’ll need to create your own Flux account and register your app at https://flux.io/developer/apps. Once you’ve created your app, you’ll be able to use the tutorials and samples with your app’s unique client ID and secret.

In this archive you’ll find libraries, documentation and samples for C#. It is recommended you start with Examples/Quickstart/Flux.SDK.Quickstart.sln. Remember to set your app’s client ID and secret in Quickstart.config before running the sample. 

The SDK libraries (referenced by the quickstart project) can be found in the Libs folder. The Flux SDK (and libraries) require .NET 4.5 or later. You’ll also need an internet connection… and some coffee. Go get yourself some coffee. You’re welcome to redistribute our libraries in your own apps under the MIT software license, which is further explained in license.txt. 

As you become more familiar with the sample code, have a look at technical docs in [Docs](./Docs/README.md) using a Markdown reader of your choice.

If you run into trouble, need some friendly advice, have something to share: head over to https://community.flux.io/developers. For urgent matters, like server outages or security concerns please contact sdk@flux.io. Thanks in advance for being a great citizen, and know that we’re always striving to improve. Good luck!
